# .NET Strategies to Simplify Data Processing: Design Patterns

## Introduction
In this repository, we demonstrate the use of four design patterns – Strategy, Visitor, Mediator, and Chain of Responsibility – to simplify complex data processing tasks in C#. This guide is an extension of the techniques discussed in the article: ".NET Strategies to Simplify Data Processing in C#: A Guide to Design Patterns."


## Contents
- `Strategy Pattern`: To replace complex conditional logic with a set of strategies.
- `Visitor Pattern`: To add operations to classes without altering their structure.
- `Mediator Pattern`: To centralize complex decision-making and orchestrate interaction between objects.
- `Chain of Responsibility Pattern`: To process a sequence of operations by passing them through a chain of handlers.

### Strategy Pattern
Here we have the IWeatherAlertStrategy interface and its concrete implementations - `StormAlertStrategy` and `HeatwaveAlertStrategy`. The `WeatherAlertProcessor` class demonstrates the use of the Strategy pattern.

### Visitor Pattern
The `WeatherData` class and `IWeatherVisitor` interface demonstrate the use of the Visitor pattern to handle different types of weather events without modifying their classes.

### Mediator Pattern
The `WeatherAlertMediator` class acts as a mediator to decouple complex interactions between different components of the weather alert system.

### Chain of Responsibility Pattern
The `WeatherHandler` abstract class and its concrete implementations show how requests can be passed through a series of handlers to process various weather alerts.

## Getting Started
To run these examples:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Set the desired project as the startup project.
4. Run the project and observe the output.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide real-world examples of how design patterns can be leveraged to create more understandable, maintainable, and flexible code. Utilizing these patterns helps to break down complex data processing tasks into manageable operations.
